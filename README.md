# discord_app

[![deno doc](https://doc.deno.land/badge.svg)](https://deno.land/x/discord_app)

Create Discord application commands.

> Application commands are native ways to interact with apps in the Discord
> client. There are 3 types of commands accessible in different interfaces: the
> chat input, a message's context menu (top-right menu or right-clicking in a
> message), and a user's context menu (right-clicking on a user).
